# Get all the specifications for one car

  # data_list[['car_id']] <- gsub('\\n','',trimws(t %>% html_node('.pull-left') %>% html_text()))
  
  tkey <- t %>% html_nodes('.property') %>% html_text()
  tvalue <- t %>% html_nodes('.value') %>% html_text()

      print(key_id)
      data_list[[  tkey[key_id]  ]] <- tvalue[key_id]
    }
  }
  return(data_list)

# EDA: Create some summary statistics plots of the data set.
# There isn't too much data analysis we can do here with the data set as most of the information are on car
# specifications. However, I am interested to see some summary statistics of the variables in the data set.

# This histogram shows the acceleration of different body types of Porsche. We can see that Porsche has 8 different
# body types in this data set, they are the Cabrio, Coupe, Fastback, Hatchback, Roadster, SUV, Targa, and Wagon. 
# The average acceleration time for Porsche car is around 5.2 seconds, with the fastest body type are the 
# Cabrio, Coupe and Roadster. 
ggplot(data = clean_df, aes(x = acceleration, fill = body_type)) + # here fill means filter
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(x = "Acceleration (in Seconds)", y = "Relative Frequency") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 13)) +
  geom_vline(data=clean_df, aes(xintercept=mean(clean_df$acceleration,na.rm=TRUE)),
             linetype="dashed")


# Next, I am also curious to see what's the maximum speed of different body types of Porsche, so I did another histogram
# that shows the average maximum speed of all body types are around 270km/h, and the body type with highest maximum
# speed is Roadster.
ggplot(data = clean_df, aes(x = max_speed, fill = body_type)) + # here fill means filter
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(x = "Max Speed (km/h)", y = "Relative Frequency") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(100, 380)) +
  geom_vline(data=clean_df, aes(xintercept=mean(clean_df$max_speed,na.rm=TRUE)),
             linetype="dashed")

# Lastly, let's also take a look at the fuel capacity of each body type. The average fuel capacity of all types is
# around 76 liters, with the highest fuel capacity for Wagon and lowest fuel capacity for Hatchback. It's not too
# surprised to see that Wagons and SUVs have the highest fuel capacity, while the Cabrio and Coupe have the lowest.
ggplot(data = clean_df, aes(x = fuel_capacity, fill = body_type)) + # here fill means filter
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(x = "Fuel Capacity (in Liters)", y = "Relative Frequency") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(40, 120)) +
  geom_vline(data=clean_df, aes(xintercept=mean(clean_df$fuel_capacity,na.rm=TRUE)),
             linetype="dashed")

# Conclusion
# In this exercise, I created two functions that automatically scrape all the car specifications for all the models
# of Porsche, and then saved it as my raw data set. I later cleaned the data set with unwanted attributes of some
# variables like special characters in numerical values, and saved as my clean data set. In the end, I also did a few
# summery statistics graphs, which shows the average acceleration time for Porsche car is around 5.2 seconds, 
# with the fastest body type are the Cabrio, Coupe and Roadster. In addition, the average maximum speed of all 
# body types are around 270km/h, and the body type with highest maximum speed is Roadster. Finally, the average fuel 
# capacity of all types is around 76 liters, with the highest fuel capacity for Wagon and lowest fuel capacity 
# for Hatchback.

# This is a very meaningful exercise because it enables the probablity of scrapping all the data from a website with
# writing a few lines of code in R. It would be also interesting to see other car-based market websites, and scrape
# the price information on different car models and types. This would be a great future exercise.
